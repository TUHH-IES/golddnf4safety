# DNF Inference for Safety Analysis

This repository implements Valiants algorithm for the inference of DNF expressions presented in Valiant [1]. The algorithm is applied for safety analysis of Mealy machine models. For automaton instantiation and simulation, [LearnLib](https://learnlib.de/) is used [2].

This work is a proof-of-concept approach. We are happy for your support by reporting or fixing any bugs in the implementation.
